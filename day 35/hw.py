#  1)Initialize an empty list and append elements from multiple smaller lists to it.
# cars = ["bmw" , "mercedes" ,"audi"]
# cars.append("honda")
# print(cars)





#  2)Initialize a list and then use the clear() method to remove all elements, making it empty.

# movies = ["the walking dead" "ricer" "bikers"]

# movies.clear()
# print (movies)



# 3)Create a list of items, then use the copy() method to make a duplicate list, serving as a backup.

# x=items.copy()
# print (x)

# 4)Create a program that counts the number of occurrences \
#     of a specific character in a given string using the count() method.|

# names = ["atuka" , "giorgi" , "luka"]
# x= names.count ("atuka")
# print (x)



# 5)Develop a program that finds the index of the first
# occurrence of a specific element in a list using the index() method

# names = ["atuka" , "giorgi" , "luka"]

# x=names.index ("luka")
# print(x)


# 6)Create a program that inserts a new element into a list at a specified index using the insert() method.

# cars= ["bmw" , "mercedes" , "honda"]
# cars.insert (2,  "audi")
# print (cars)

# 7)Create a program that removes and returns the last element from a list using the pop() method.

# movies = ["spiderman" , "batman" , "starwars"]
# movies.pop  (1)
# print (movies)

# 8)Write a program that removes a specific element from a list using the remove() method.

# cars = ["bmw" , "mercedes" , "honda"]

# cars.remove ("mercedes")
# print (cars)



# 9)Create a list of numbers and then use the reverse() method
# to reverse the order of elements in the list.

# names = ["mari" , "nia" , "kato"]

# names.reverse ()
# print(names)

# 10)Create a list of numbers and then use the sort() method to sort them in ascending order.
# numbers= [1 ,2 ,5 ,4 ,7 ,6 ,9 ,8]
# numbers.sort()
# print(numbers)

# 11)Create a list and use the len() function to count the number of elements in it.
# list = [ "apple" , "banana" ,"cherry"]
# x=len(list)
# print (x)


# 12)Create two lists and use the extend() method to append elements of one list to another.

# cars = ["bmw" , "corvette" ,"mercedes"]
# movies = ["spiderman" , "batman" , "grinch"]
# cars.extend(movies)
# print(cars)


# 13)Take a word as input and use the capitalize() method to capitalize the first letter.
# txt = "helloo buddyy  its  georgiaaa"

# x = txt.capitalize()

# print (x)




# 14)Take a string as input and use the count() method to count the occurrences of a specific character.

# txt = " georgia georgia georgia georgia georgia"

# x = txt.count("georgia")

# print(x)


# 15)Take a string as input and use the index() method
# to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific character.

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# x = fruits.index("apple")

# print(x)


# 16)Input the user to enter a username and use the isalnum() 
# method to verify if it contains only alphanumeric characters.


# txt = "muzaaaa"

# x = txt.isalnum()

# print(x)


# 17)Given a list of strings, filter out the strings that contain 
# non-alphabetic characters using the isalpha() method

# txt = "sgsgsgsgsggsgs"

# x = txt.isalpha()

# print(x)

# 18)Input the user to enter a numeric value and use the
# isdigit() method to verify if it consists only of digits



# txt = "380005"

# x = txt.isdigit()

# print(x)



# 19)input the user to enter a string and use the islower()
# method to verify if it consists only of lowercase letters.


# txt = "dila mshvidobisa saqartvelooo"

# x = txt.islower()

# print(x)




# 20)Verify if a word consists only of uppercase letters using
# the isupper() method before further processing or analysis.


# txt = "erbo erboa qoni qonia xo"

# x = txt.isupper()

# print(x)



# 21)Convert a user's input to lowercase using the lower()
# method to ensure uniformity for further processing.


# txt = "rais dzmakacebi tqven xart simonn"

# x = txt.lower()

# print(x)

# 22)Given a string, replace all occurrences of a specified
# substring with another substring using the replace() method.

# txt = "I like corvette"

# x = txt.replace("corvette", "bmwwww")

# print(x)




# 23)Given a sentence, split it into individual words using the split() method for further analysis.

# txt = "mobrdzandi simon chems saxlshii"

# x = txt.split()

# print(x)




# 24)Given a list of strings, filter out the strings that start
# with a specific prefix using the startswith() method


# txt = "bmw chemi cxovrebaa chemi dedas vficavar"
# x = txt.startswith("bmw")

# print(x)


# 25)Given a string, check if it ends with a specific character or substring using the endswith() method.

# txt = "gamarjobat sazogadoebav."

# x = txt.endswith(".")

# print(x)


# 26)Given a string, convert all uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa using the swapcase() method.


# txt = "gaumarjos chems dzmasss"

# x = txt.swapcase()

# print(x)
